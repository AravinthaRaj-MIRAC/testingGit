# CodeX Open Source Code of Conduct  
This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in CodeX-managed open source communities, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.  

Our open source communities strive to:  

- __Be friendly and patient:__ Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.  
- __Be welcoming:__ Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.  
- __Be respectful:__ We are a community of developers, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:  
  - Violent threats or language.
  - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
  - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
- __Understand disagreements:__ Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
- This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
# Scope
This code of conduct applies to all repos and communities for CodeX-managed open source projects regardless of whether or not the repo explicitly calls out its use of this code. The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.  

This code of conduct is based on the template established by the TODO Group and used by numerous other large communities (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and the Scope section from the Contributor Covenant version 1.4.
